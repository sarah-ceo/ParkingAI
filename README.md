# ParkingAI
This is a school project: an AI car learning to park itself, using Unity and ML-Agents. We made it into a game (Player vs. AI).

This project was inspired by the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMp6pq6_QjI (AI Learns to Park - Deep Reinforcement Learning)

## Instructions
In the Build/ folder you can run the game for Windows or MacOS. Or you can open the solution in Unity.

There are 3 scenes: GameManager which is the game itself, BasicTraining and ParkingTraining.

## Training
We used two training scenes: one in a simpler environment (BasicTraining), and one in the parking lot (ParkingTraining).

We started from the RollerBall example of ML-Agents. We modified the Agent to turn it into a car, and used the observations and configuration file provided in the following article: https://auro.ai/blog/2020/05/learning-to-drive/ . We added Ray Perception Sensors to the car, and set the reward for reaching the target to +1.0.

We first trained the agent to find a target:

We then replaced the target with our parking spot, progressively increasing the constraints to receive the reward: to be considered parked in the game, the car must be less than 0.3 away and the angle bewteen the car and the parking spot must be less than 15Â°. So we started with (distance, angle) : (1.0, 45), then decreased to  (0.75, 30), (0.5, 20), and finally (0.3, 15).

We then added obstacles, with -1.0 reward (and EndEpisode) if the car collides with one. The obstacles are the other cars and the walls.

Once the mean reward reached a plateau, we changed the environment to the parking lot and trained it further:

We reached a mean cumulative reward of ~0.88 .

## Game
We added our trained AI to the game, and it was pretty decent.

We could probably increase its performance by modifying the configuration file and increasing the length of the car sensors.
